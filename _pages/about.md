I am currently a Ph.D. candidate majored in Bioinformatics and Scientific Computing at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, co-advised [Dr. Todd Hollon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=37OCG3gAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Brian Athey](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/psychiatry/brian-d-athey-phd). Previously I received a M.S. in Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan and B.S. in statistics at the Chines Universiyt of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.

My research interests include self-supervised learning, computer vision and multimodal machine learning, as well as their real world applications, such as in AI in healthcare and medicine. I am currently working on integrating multimodal information for patient survival prediction.

Prior to my Ph.D. program, I worked with [Dr. Pengfei Xiong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ctLbu3IAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) as machine learning engineer intern in Tencent on title generation and video tagging.
