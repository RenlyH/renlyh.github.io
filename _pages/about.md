[[Curriculum Vitae](../assets/pdf/xinhaihou_umich.pdf)]

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Bioinformatics and Scientific Computing at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where I am co-advised by [Dr. Todd Hollon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=37OCG3gAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Brian Athey](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/psychiatry/brian-d-athey-phd). I hold an M.S. in Bioinformatics from the University of Michigan and a B.S. in Statistics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.

My research focuses on self-supervised learning, computer vision, and multimodal machine learning, with a particular emphasis on real-world applications such as AI in healthcare and medicine. Currently, I am working on integrating multimodal data (vision, genomic, language) to improve patient survival prediction models.

Before starting my Ph.D. program, I worked as a machine learning engineer intern at Tencent under the supervision of [Dr. Pengfei Xiong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ctLbu3IAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), where I contributed to projects involving title generation and video tagging.
