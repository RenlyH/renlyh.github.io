I am currently a Ph.D. candidate major in Bioinformatics and Scientific Computing at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, co-advised Dr. Todd Hollon and Dr. Brian Athey. Previously I received a M.S. in Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan and B.S. in statistics at the Chines Universiyt of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.

My research interests include self-supervised learning, computer vision and multimodal machine learning, as well as their applications in the real world, such as in AI in healthcare and medicine. I am currently working integrating multimodal information for patient survival prediction.

Prior to my Ph.D. program, I worked with Dr. Pengfei Xiong as machine learning engineer intern in Tencent on title generation and video tagging.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
