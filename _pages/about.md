I am currently a Ph.D. candidate majoring in Bioinformatics and Scientific Computing at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, co-advised by [Dr. Todd Hollon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=37OCG3gAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Brian Athey](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/psychiatry/brian-d-athey-phd). Previously, I received an M.S. in Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan and a B.S. in Statistics at the Chines University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.

My research interests include self-supervised learning, computer vision, and multimodal machine learning, as well as their real-world applications, such as in AI in healthcare and medicine. I am currently working on integrating multimodal information for patient survival prediction.

Prior to my Ph.D. program, I worked with [Dr. Pengfei Xiong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ctLbu3IAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) as a machine learning engineer intern at Tencent on title generation and video tagging.
